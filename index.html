        <strong> A STORY, AND A MYTH </strong>
        <br> <br>
        As of 2017, 8, 10, and 30 percent of Guatemalan, Honduran, and El Salvadorian working-age populations, respectively, resided outside their home countries, with most residing in the United States.
        <br><br> 
        As a result, in 2018, remittance flows to the region from emigrants exceeded 19 billion USD, accounting for 12.1, 20.1, and 20.7 percent, respectively, of GDP in Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. [1]
        <br><br> 
        At this point, a leap in rhetoric is often made: that Northern Triangle immigrants, who often migrate irregularly, are <strong class='higlighted' id='intro-highlight'>draining resources and capital </strong> from the United States to <strong class='higlighted' id='intro-highlight'>fuel extravagance</strong> in their home country, to build an upper-class wealth. When such misinterpretation transforms to disinformation, the result fuels anti-immigrant sentiment, unpredictable swings in immigration policy, and little improvement in the available regular pathways for migration.
        <br><br> 
           </div>
      <div >  
        But this conclusion is far from the truth: to illustrate why, we have to characterize the households in the Northern Triangle that receive remittances, and what precisely the remittances pay for.
        <br><br> 
        So we found ourselves asking, what is the average monthly remittance amount received by households in the Northern Triangle by country and urban-rural classification, and for what purposes is this money spent?

            <strong>THE STUDY</strong>
            <br><br>
            
            Luckily, a recent survey conducted by the World Food Programme helps unearth this information. 
            <br><br>Of the nearly 5000 participants of the survey, which asks questions ranging from relationships to those who emigrated, to plans of the survey participant of ever migrating, to food security and well-being, 1447 respondents reported that they received remittances from someone abroad. Of these, 709 respondents received remittances on a regular basis, and graciously consented to providing detailed information about their household’s use of this money. We can try to understand from their responses how remittances are generally used in the Northern Triangle.
            <br><br>Here, we represent each of these <strong class="higlighted" id="combined-highlight">709 households</strong>, each of these families in the Northern Triangle Region, as a circle, with size corresponding to the amount of remittances received monthly. You can <strong>hover</strong> over each to learn about the amount their household receives in remittances on average per month, as well as their self-reported household income. Let’s try to discern some information from this survey.

            <ul>
                <li>220 said they lived in <strong class='higlighted' id='gt'>Guatemala</strong>. They on average received 125.33 USD/mo in remittances.</li>
                <li>151 said they lived in <strong class='highlighted' id='hnd'>Honduras</strong>. They on averaged received 144.21 USD/mo.</li>
                <li>338 responded saying they lived in  <strong class='higlighted' id='slv'>El Salvador</strong>, receiving on average 135.71 USD/mo.</li>

            <!-- For comparison, these amount to less than 10% of overall average estimated monthly costs for a family of four in each of the Northern Triangle countries, without rent. [3] -->
            For comparison, for a family of four, the overall average estimated monthly costs excluding rent is 2,097.67 USD in Guatemala, 1,884.52 USD in Honduras, and 2,029.16 USD in El Salvador, according to NUMBEO. [3]

            <br><br>Rural-area participants received a similar amount in remittances per month on average, according to self-report, to urban-area participants, about 134.79 USD/mo compared to 133.44 USD/mo.

            <br><br>Now let’s view what each household reported they use  remittance money towards. When asked about the expenses remittances cover, survey participants had the following options with which to respond, in decreasing order of response frequency:

                    To answer the question of how remittances are most often used, let's visualize the number of survey respondents using remittance funds towards the most basic needs like food, utilities like light, water, and mobile communication,  health, education, clothing, housing/housing rental/home purchase, and all other uses, including business, agriculture, and debt payment.

    <div class='wrap-up'><strong>WHAT HAVE WE LEARNT?</strong> </div>

    <div class="hist"></div>
</div>
<div class='wrap-up'>
    We have learnt that the story of remittances runs deeper than the myth: as recently as 2021, Northern Triangle households report using this money towards covering the most basic of needs, with less than 10% of respondents using remittances for expenses beyond food, utilities, and health, and only 6.06% using remittances for expenses beyond food, utilities, health, education, clothing, and housing, like business ventures and savings.
    <br><br>
    So what can we do about it? 
    <ul>
        <li>We need to be aware of this when supporting radical shifts in migration policy that disrupt this critical income source.</li>
        <li>We need compassion in our discussions of the migration and development in the Northern Triangle, understanding how those on the ground are directly impacted.</li>
        <li>We need to acknowledge the impact of remittances in our discussions of improving pathways to regular migration to the United States for those who would like to.</li>
    </ul>
