    <div class="introduction">
        <strong> A STORY, AND A MYTH </strong>
        <br> <br>
        As of 2017, 8, 10, and 30 percent of Guatemalan, Honduran, and El Salvadorian working-age populations, respectively, resided outside their home countries, with most residing in the United States.
        <br><br> 
        As a result, in 2018, remittance flows to the region from emigrants exceeded 19 billion USD, accounting for 12.1, 20.1, and 20.7 percent, respectively, of GDP in Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. [1]
        <br><br> 
        At this point, a leap in rhetoric is often made: that Northern Triangle immigrants, who often migrate irregularly, are draining resources and capital from the United States to fuel extravagance in their home country, to build an upper-class wealth. When such misinterpretation transforms to disinformation, the result fuels anti-immigrant sentiment, unpredictable swings in immigration policy, and little improvement in the available regular pathways for migration.
        <br><br> 
        But this conclusion is far from the truth: to illustrate why, we have to characterize the households in the Northern Triangle that receive remittances, and what precisely the remittances pay for.

                    <strong>THE STUDY</strong>
                    <br><br>
                    Luckily, a recent survey conducted by the World Food Programme helps unearth this information. 
                    <br><br>Of the nearly 5000 participants of the survey, which asks questions ranging from relationships to those who emigrated, to plans of the survey participant of ever migrating, to food security and well-being, 1447 respondents reported that they received remittances from someone abroad. Of these, <strong>709</strong> respondents received remittances on a regular basis, and graciously consented to providing detailed information about their household’s use of this money. We can try to understand from their responses how remittances are generally used in the Northern Triangle.
                    <br><br>Here, we represent each of these 709 households, each of these families in the Northern Triangle Region, as a circle. You can hover over each to learn about the amount their household receives in remittances on average per month, as well as their self-reported household income. Let’s try to discern some information from this survey.

                    <strong>A VIEW OF REMITTANCE-RECEIVING HOUSEHOLDS BY COUNTRY</strong> 
                    <br><br>Of the 709 respondents, 220 said they lived in <strong class='higlighted' id='gt'>Guatemala</strong>, 151 said they lived in <strong class='highlighted' id='hnd'>Honduras</strong>, 338 said they lived in <strong class='higlighted' id='slv'>El Salvador</strong>. The average amount of remittances received by households per month by according to the survey participants was 125.33 USD/mo, 144.21 USD/mo, and 135.71 USD/mo, respectively.

                    <strong>A VIEW OF REMITTANCE-RECEIVING HOUSEHOLDS IN RURAL vs. URBAN AREAS</strong> 
                    <br><br>Of the 709 respondents, 450 were from <strong class="higlighted" id="rural" >rural</strong> areas, and 259 from <strong class="higlighted" id="urban" >urban</strong>. Rural-area participants received a similar amount in remittances per month on average, according to self-report, to urban-area participants, about 134.79 USD/mo compared to 133.44 USD/mo.

                    <br><br>Now let’s view what each household reported they use  remittance money towards. We’ll start with basic needs like food, utilities like light, water, and mobile communication, and health, and then look at needs just beyond those, like education and clothing.

        <strong>SO WHAT HAVE WE LEARNT?</strong> 
        <br><br>
            We have learnt that the story of remittances runs deeper than the myth: as recently as 2021, Northern Triangle households report using this money towards covering the most basic of needs. 
            <br><br>
            So what can we do about it? 
            <ul>
                <li>We need to be aware of this when supporting radical shifts in migration policy that disrupt this critical income source.</li>
                <li>We need compassion in our discussions of the migration and development in the Northern Triangle, understanding how those on the ground are directly impacted.</li>
                <li>We need to acknowledge the impact of remittances in our discussions of improving pathways to regular migration to the United States for those who would like to.</li>
